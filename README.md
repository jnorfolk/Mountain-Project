# Mountain-Project

This is an ongoing personal project where I attempt to find trends in my rock climbing accomplishments. 

I am using data downloaded from my Mountain Project account, which is an open source database that contains extensive information on climbing routes across North America.
I have been inputting data from nearly every route I've tried or attempted in the last 2-3 years.
I spent a year living out of my car, working and traveling, and rock climbing as often as I could manage. 
Eventually, I would like to refine this data into a format that will allow me to make predictions on my ability to climb routes based on difficulty, location, style, etc.
